    <h3>Hi Everyone,</h3>
    <p>
       I, being someone who enjoys to spend my extra time doing what I love most or something impactful at a long run; some of those activities include stuffs like cooking, reading, writing, thinking, playing, designing, outreaches and lots more
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Cooking might be of more interest to me because I view it as an art. An art takes a considerable amount of time, work and effort, and not just that, but the feeling of every fabric of nature in what you do. You see in cooking, from the Looks, to the aroma, down to the taste, everything needs to be in check and for everything to be as such, the following resources would be needed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>A pot</strong></li>
      <li><strong>A Fire source</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Ingredients</strong></li> such as Maggi Cubes, Salt, Curry, Thyme, Cabbage, Carrots, Green beans, Peas, Mayonnaise etc
      <li><strong>A beautiful plate and a handsome spoon</strong> (just for fun by the way)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <p>Okay, with all that been said let me take you through this art i love. For instance I would love to be cooking jollof rice today, so with all the ingredients or resources needed all chopped and diced, grounded and washed, i then place my pot on the lited cooker, turn in some oil into the pot and then added the wonderful ingredients into the heated oil, and these ingredients which i call the fri-ables included the onion, tomatoes etc pending on how rich you are at the moment. After the fri-ables have been fried you gently add water and then you could cover the pot and allow to heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the water is heated, I then added my washed perboiled rice, and  the buds stimulators, these includes the nasal and taste stimulators; such as the curry, thyme, maggi, salt and other seasonings and if money allows I could add the enjoy-ables such as cooked diced beef or liver, and after that I allow to cook for about 30-35 minutes and then I added other ingredients such as green beans, carrots, peas etc, then I allowed to cook for about 5-10 minutes. Then Wow! my FOOD is done but not ready though, I then began the preparation of the salad and after that when all is set and in place then my Jollof Rice is Ready when just as seen below.
        And Yummy to my stomach it went with a cup of wine to push through.

    <p>P.S. One thing I want to remind you is that following instructions carefully is key to success in programming. Whether you're building a small webpage or coding an advanced application, listening to guidelines is a foundational habit that ensures quality work. So letâ€™s stick to what we've learned and master each step along the way! We'll get to CSS soon.
